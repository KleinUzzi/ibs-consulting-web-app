    <Question title="Can I pay for the service in installents?">
        <p>Yes, many of our clients pay in installments. We understand times can be tough, and we never want money to be the reason why clients don't book.</p>
    </Question>
    <Question title="When do I pay?">
        <p>We take payment upfront/an initial deposit prior to starting work.</p>
    </Question>
    <Question title="How come your success rate is so high?">
        <p>One word – due diligence. We thoroughly assess all our clients’ qualifications for the programs and programs they are interested in prior to taking them on as clients. If we aren't confident in your chances, we don't take you on as client.</p>

    <Question title="Will Shamima work on everything? I want just her to work on it.">

    <Question title="You are usually fully booked. When is the best time to book?">
        <p>In our experience, we advise that you book and pay to secure your slot a month and more ahead of the actual month you want to start working on your deliverables. This means if your deadline is November, September is probably the best time to book so your deliverables can be completed in October. We must prioritize clients that booked ahead of time each month. </p>
